Aim:Operating System-Based Question:
This experiment combines data structures and operating system concepts, focusing on Linked Lists and OS-related problems.
Objective:
To understand the implementation and operations of Linked Lists while exploring their applications in Operating System concepts such as memory management, scheduling, and resource allocation.
